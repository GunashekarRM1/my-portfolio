<section class="card about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am Gunashekar Reddy, a dedicated Full Stack Developer and Software Engineer with a strong passion for building
    scalable, secure, and performance-driven applications. I specialize in developing complete digital solutions,
    handling everything from user-facing interfaces to backend services and mobile applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    My approach to software development is deeply rooted in clean architecture, maintainability, and long-term
    scalability. I believe great software is not just about writing functional code, but about designing systems
    that remain reliable, adaptable, and easy to extend as requirements evolve.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the frontend, I work extensively with Angular and React to build responsive, interactive, and visually
    engaging user interfaces. I focus on component-driven development, efficient state management, performance
    optimization, and accessibility to ensure smooth user experiences across all screen sizes and devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the backend, I build robust APIs and services using .NET and Python with FastAPI. I design backend systems
    with strong emphasis on security, scalability, and performance, following best practices such as RESTful
    architecture, proper authentication and authorization, structured error handling, and clean API documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also have hands-on experience in mobile application development using Flutter and React Native. I enjoy
    creating cross-platform mobile applications that deliver near-native performance, smooth animations, and
    consistent user experiences on both Android and iOS platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of my key strengths is my ability to connect frontend, backend, and mobile layers into a single cohesive
    system. I approach applications as complete products rather than isolated components, ensuring seamless
    communication between all layers of the technology stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    Performance optimization is a priority in my development process. Whether it is improving page load times,
    optimizing API responses, or reducing unnecessary network calls, I consistently look for opportunities to
    enhance efficiency and responsiveness.
  </p>

  <p>
    I value clean, readable, and well-structured code. I follow consistent coding standards, modular design
    principles, and meaningful naming conventions, making the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and scale
    in team environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond technical skills, I believe communication and continuous learning are essential qualities of a strong
    software engineer. I actively keep myself updated with new tools, frameworks, and best practices while being
    adaptable to changing project requirements and technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am comfortable working both independently and collaboratively within a team. I take ownership of my work,
    manage tasks efficiently, and communicate progress clearly, ensuring alignment with project goals and timelines.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, my goal is to build software solutions that solve real-world problems, deliver tangible value,
    and provide excellent user experiences while continuously growing as an engineer and professional.
