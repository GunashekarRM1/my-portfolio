  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am Gunasekhar Reddy, a dedicated Full Stack Developer and Software Engineer with a strong passion for building
    scalable, secure, and performance-driven applications. I specialize in developing complete digital solutions,
    handling everything from user-facing interfaces to backend services and mobile applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    My approach to software development is deeply rooted in clean architecture, maintainability, and long-term
    scalability. I believe great software is not just about writing functional code, but about designing systems
    that remain reliable, adaptable, and easy to extend as requirements evolve.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the frontend, I work extensively with Angular and React to build responsive, interactive, and visually
    engaging user interfaces. I focus on component-driven development, efficient state management, performance
    optimization, and accessibility to ensure smooth user experiences across all screen sizes and devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the backend, I build robust APIs and services using .NET and Python with FastAPI. I design backend systems
    with strong emphasis on security, scalability, and performance, following best practices such as RESTful
    architecture, authentication, authorization, and clean API documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also have hands-on experience in mobile application development using Flutter and React Native. I enjoy
    creating cross-platform mobile applications that deliver near-native performance and polished user experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of my key strengths is my ability to connect frontend, backend, and mobile layers into a single cohesive
    system, ensuring seamless communication across the entire technology stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, my goal is to build software solutions that solve real-world problems, deliver tangible value,
    and provide excellent user experiences while continuously growing as an engineer.
